#### **Hi there...**  

I've created this website for personal learning and development with the occasional rant.  

#### **Things I like to chat about: ** 

* Data science, mainly related to marketing
* Gambling
* Philosophy  

This website is built using R Markdown in [RStudio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) which is super cool.  

#### **I like code and graphs... especially maps  **

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

content <- paste(sep = "<br/>",
                 "<b><a href='https://www.theadelphileeds.co.uk/'>My local - beer, beer, beer</a></b>",
                 "The Adelphi",
                 "1-3 Hunslet Road",
                 "Leeds, LS10 1JQ"
)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng=-1.540, lat=53.793, zoom = 16) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPopups(lng=-1.540, lat=53.793, 
            content,
            options = popupOptions(closeButton = FALSE))
m

```
